# Hello There!
This is a work in progress.
Currently I have deduced that the 100x optimization was obtained on optimizing the `neighbours` function.
In that function a undirected graph was converted into a directed graph and that lead to the most gain in speed.

Please check out the [notebook](https://github.com/yackoa/BFS_code_optimization_notebook/blob/master/BFS.ipynb) for more details and thought process.
It has a cool heatmap showing where the actual slowness was.

Feel free to contribute!
